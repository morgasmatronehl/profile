				<h2>UX/UI Design 📐</h2>
				<p>
					As a <strong> front-end developer and UX/UI designer</strong>, I have
					a deep love of design and a passion for creating visually stunning
					interfaces. Whether it's experimenting with color schemes, typography,
					or layout, I am constantly pushing the boundaries to create unique and
					engaging designs that delight users. At the end of the day, I believe
					that good design has the power to transform a simple website into a
					work of art, and that's why I'm so passionate about what I do.

				<h2>Frontend Development 💻</h2>
				<p>
					As a <strong>front-end developer</strong>, I have to admit, I'm a bit
					of a perfectionist. I mean, who else would spend hours adjusting the
					spacing on a button until it's pixel-perfect? But hey, when it comes
					to creating a seamless user experience, every detail matters!

				<h2>Football ⚽️</h2>
				<p>
					As a <strong>Spurs</strong> fan, I can't help but draw parallels
					between front-end development and football. Just like a football team
					needs a solid defense to keep the opposition at bay, a website needs a
					strong front-end to keep users engaged and coming back for more. And
					just like a striker needs precision and finesse to score goals, a
					front-end developer needs pixel-perfect designs and clean code to
					create the perfect user experience. #COYS
